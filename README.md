# Midnight
A dice game you can play in terminal with the bot or your friend.

## Rules
- You have 6 standard dice. <br />
- There are two players; this program will allow a human vs. human, human vs. bot, and bot vs. bot.  <br />
- Player A rolls all six of the dice. They must "bank" at least one die after each roll. Any dice that aren't banked are re-rolled.  <br />
- By the time there are no dice left to roll, Player A must have banked a 1 and a 4. Their score is determined by adding the values of all dice rolled.  <br />
- Player B repeats the steps described above.  <br />
- The player with the highest score wins. If the two players tie, the game begins again.  <br />
